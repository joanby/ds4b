# Covid-19_and_Pneumonia_X-Ray_Detector
Aim of this project is to detect Covid-19 from X-ray and also able to differentitate Covid-19 from viral pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia. I have created a custom dataset that contains covid-19 x-ray images, viral pneumonia x-ray images, bacterial pneumonia x-ray iamges and normal person x-ray images.Each class contains 133 images.
